description : 'Mediawiki extension providing a testing framework for the Lua programming language.'
---

This extension for Mediawiki adds a Pickle testing framework to Lua modules. An integral part is to report failures clearly and visible to facilitate interactive and collaborative fault fixing, by adding a test console and tracking of state changes. An important end result of using this extension is to create a faster _test_ – _code_ – _refactor_ loop.

This is still work in progress, but most of the code is checked in.
