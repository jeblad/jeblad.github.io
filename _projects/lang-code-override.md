description : Mediawiki extension to override language codes in a wiki farm.
---

This extension for Mediawiki makes it possible to configure overrides for the language codes. It can be necessary to override the codes due to several reasons, but a rather common one is historical use of a faulty prefix to the domain address. A core reason to override the language code is to lower the tensions in the community over faulty codes.
