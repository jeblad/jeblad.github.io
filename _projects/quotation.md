description : 'Mediawiki extension providing a framework for checking quotes in Wikipedia.'
---

This extension for Mediawiki adds basic features for quotes in citations. This is to facilitate continuous verification of the validity of those statements, and their reuse in wikitext. A core part is to report inconsistencies clearly and visible to facilitate interactive and collaborative fault fixing.
