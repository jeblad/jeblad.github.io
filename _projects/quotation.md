description : Mediawiki extension providing a framework for checking quotes in a wiki.
---

This extension for Mediawiki adds tracking of quotes from external pages. This is to facilitate continuous verification of the validity of those statements, whether they can still be verified, and how they are reused in wikitext. A core part is to report inconsistencies clearly and visible to facilitate interactive and collaborative fault fixing.
