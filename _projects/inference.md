description : Mediawiki extension to filter down semantic data from a Wikibase repo and make it available to Lua modules.
---

This extension for Mediawiki adds a simple inference engine to query and build sets of entities from a Wikibase repository. By providing these as filtered sets of statements they can be used by modules to build highly advanced templates. An important part of this is to lower the overall work involved in creating inference engines.

This is a work in progress, and most of the code is not even checked in.
