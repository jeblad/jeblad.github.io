This site is devoted to various topics that the author(s) find interesting, probably with a slight bias towards [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) and perhaps the subfield [artificial neural net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence). Most of the articles should be fairly easy reading, while the more lengthy articles might be more demanding.

In addition to the blog posts there are pages about the authors on this site, technical papers, and various projects. The pages about authors, papers, and projects will only have some defining content, and will link out to other sites. It can be expected that the [papers]() collection will link to more heavy reading. Blog posts will describe all of them in further detail when necessary.

The blog post should have a byline where at least the main author is listed.
