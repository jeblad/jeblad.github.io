I am a computer scientist, with a cand. sci. in mathematical modeling of analog processors
for neuromorph audio processing. In other words how to localize sound sources by using an
analog computer with transistors in low inversion. Very cool, and very weird. That was back
then, when the neural net field was new, and people still believed analog processing was the
way to go. Since then most funding has dried up, and I do web programming as most other
people in IT-science. But the way to go is still analog processing, it is just the rest of
the world does not know it.
