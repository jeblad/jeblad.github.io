[**Crowdsourcing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing) (Norwegian: *Nettdugnad*) is a sourcing model in which individuals or organizations obtain goods and services, including ideas and finances, from a large, relatively open and often rapidly-evolving group of internet users; it divides work between participants to achieve a cumulative result. The word crowdsourcing itself is a portmanteau of crowd and outsourcing, and was coined in 2005.
