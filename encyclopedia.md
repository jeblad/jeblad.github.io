[**Encyclopedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia) is a reference work or compendium providing summaries of knowledge from either all branches or from a particular field or discipline. Encyclopedias are divided into articles or entries that are often arranged alphabetically by article name, and sometimes by thematic categories. Encyclopedia entries are longer and more detailed than those in most dictionaries. Generally speaking encyclopedia articles focus on factual information concerning the subject named in the article's title.
