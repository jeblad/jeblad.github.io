[*Neural networks*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network) are networks or circuits of neurons, or in a modern sense, artificial neural networks, composed of artificial neurons or nodes. Thus a neural network is either a biological neural network, made up of real biological neurons, or an artificial neural network, for solving artificial intelligence (AI) problems. The connections of the biological neuron are modeled as weights. A positive weight reflects an excitatory connection, while negative values reflects inhibitory connections.
