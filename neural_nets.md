[**Neural networks**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network) (Norwegian: *Nevrale nett*) are either [biological neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neural_network) consisting of [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron), or in a modern and simplified sense [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) consisting of artificial nodes with activation functions. The connections of the [biological neuron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neuron_model) are modeled as weights in the [artificial node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neuron). Positive weights reflects [excitatory synapses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitatory_synapse), while negative weights reflects [inhibitory synapses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhibitory_synapse).
