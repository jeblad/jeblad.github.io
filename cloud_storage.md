[**Cloud storage**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_storage) (Norwegian: *Skylagring*) is a model of computer data storage in which the digital data is stored in logical pools. The physical storage spans multiple servers (sometimes in multiple locations), and the physical environment is typically owned and managed by a hosting company. These cloud storage providers are responsible for keeping the data available and accessible, and the physical environment protected and running.
